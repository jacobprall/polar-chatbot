# Writing Polar Code

## Language Basics

Polar is a declarative logic programming language. You state what should be true; Polar computes how to achieve it.

### How Polar Executes

Rules define when predicates are true:

```polar
father("SisterBear", "PapaBear");
father("BrotherBear", "PapaBear");
```

Multiple rules can use the same predicate.

### Conditional Rules

```polar
grandfather(grandchild: String, grandparent: String) if
  parent matches String and
  father(grandchild, parent) and
  father(parent, grandparent);
```

Most rules follow `statement if condition;` form. Variables must be explicitly typed.

## Built-in Types

Polar uses explicitly typed data with two classes of types:

| Class         | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primitive** | Represents literal values, such as numbers.                                                                 |
| **Abstract**  | Represents a type that you want to represent in your authorization policy, such as users and organizations. |

### Primitive Types

| Type      | Description           | Example |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| `String`  | String of text        | `"a"`   |
| `Integer` | 64-bit signed integer | `-3`    |
| `Boolean` | true or false values  | `true`  |

Use in rule parameters or facts:

```polar
is_string_a(x: String) if x = "a";
```

Strings represent permission names, roles, and relations by convention.

#### Object Literal Representation

Express primitives as object literals using type name + value in curly brackets:

```polar
Boolean{true}
```

#### Fact Argument Length Limit

Each fact argument has a 384-byte limit. This applies per argument:

```polar
has_relation(Foo{"<384-byte string>"}, "<384-byte-string>", Bar{"384-byte string>"})
```

### Abstract Types

| Type       | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Resource` | An object to which you want to authorize types of access. Identify subtypes with the `resource` keyword. |
| `Actor`    | An entity to whom you want to grant types of access. Identify subtypes with the `actor` keyword.         |

Create custom types by extending these abstracts using resource blocks.

Never use abstract types as object literals (e.g., never use `Resource{"foo"}`).

## Rules and Facts

Rules consist of:
- **Predicate**: Rule name
- **Parameters**: Named types
- **Expression**: Optional conditional clause

```polar
within(lower: Integer, upper: Integer, x: Integer) if lower < x and x < upper;
```

### Facts

Rules without expressions are facts (unconditionally true):

```polar
parent("Bernie", "Pat");
parent("Bernie", "Morgan");
```

### Variable Typing

Use `matches` for new variables:

```polar
family(a: String, b: String) if
  parent matches String and
  parent(a, parent) and parent(parent, b);
```

### Literal Parameters

Rules can use literal values:

```polar
cities_to_visit("Phoenix", season: String) if is_cold(season);
```

### Default Allow Rules

If no `allow` predicate exists, Polar includes:

```polar
allow(actor, action, resource) if has_permission(actor, action, resource);
allow(actor, action) if has_permission(actor, action);
```

### Deny Logic

Create deny rules using negation in allow rules:

```polar
allow(actor: Actor, action: String, resource: Resource) if
  has_permission(actor, action, resource) and
  not is_banned(actor);
```

### Singletons

Variables occurring only once generate warnings. Prefix with `_` to suppress or use `_` for anonymous variables.

### Fact Limits

- No hard limit on stored facts
- Context facts limited by 10 MiB request payload
- Each fact argument â‰¤384 bytes

## Operators

### Unification (=)

Checks if operands unify (are equal or can be made equal with variable bindings):

```polar
"a" = "a"
x = "a"
["a", "b"] = [x, "b"]
```

String unification is case-sensitive.

### Conjunction (and)

Both conditions must hold:

```polar
oso_employee(first, last) if
  is_user(first, last) and
  is_employee("Oso", first, last);
```

### Disjunction (or)

Either condition must hold:

```polar
is_user(first, last) if
  oso_employee(first, last) or
  is_guest(first, last);
```


### List Membership (in)

Iterates over string lists:

```polar
x in ["a", "b", "c"]
x in ["a", "b", "c"] and x = "a"
"a" in ["a", "b", "c", "a"]
```

### Integer Comparisons

Use `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for integers:

```polar
expires_after_y2k38(resource) if
  expires_at(resource, time) and time > 2147483647
```

### Matches Operator

Assert variable type when introducing new variables:

```polar
role_on_resource(actor: Actor, role: String, resource: Resource) if
  group matches Group and
  has_group(actor, group) and
  has_role(group, role, resource);
```

### Operator Precedence

From highest to lowest:
1. `in, matches`
2. `=, <, <=, >, >=`
3. `not`
4. `and`
5. `or`

Use parentheses `()` to override precedence.

## Resource Blocks

Resource blocks declare custom types and provide RBAC/ReBAC features.

### Basic Syntax

```polar
actor User {}
resource Repository {}
```

Each type must be declared as `actor` or `resource`.

### Global Block

One optional global block per policy for global roles/permissions:

```polar
global {
  roles = ["admin"];
}

resource Organization {
  roles = ["internal_admin"];
  "internal_admin" if global "admin";
}
```

### Permissions, Roles, and Relations

#### Permissions

Actions that actors can perform:

```polar
resource Repository {
  permissions = ["read", "push"];
}
```

#### Roles

Actor classifications:

```polar
resource Repository {
  roles = ["contributor", "maintainer", "admin"];
}
```

#### Relations

Relationships between resources:

```polar
resource Repository {
  relations = { parent: Organization };
}
```

Requirements:
- Values must be string literals
- Each feature declared at most once per block
- Values must be unique within each block
- Must be declared to use in shorthand rules

### Shorthand Rules

Basic form:

```polar
<role or permission> if <expression>;
```

Example:

```polar
resource Repository {
  permissions = ["read", "push"];
  roles = ["contributor", "maintainer"];
  relations = { parent: Organization };

  "read" if "contributor";
  "push" if "maintainer";
  "admin" if "admin" on "parent";
}
```

#### Left-hand Side

Can be:
- A role: `"contributor"`
- A permission: `"read"`
- Keywords `role` or `permission` (any role/permission)

#### Right-hand Side

Can be:
- Role: `"contributor"`
- Permission: `"read"`
- Role/permission on relation: `"reader" on "parent"`
- Rule call: `is_public(resource)`

Combine with `and` and `or`.

#### Expansion Examples

Without relation:

```polar
"read" if "contributor";
# Expands to:
has_permission(actor: Actor, "read", resource: Repository) if has_role(actor, "contributor", resource);
```

With relation:

```polar
"admin" if "owner" on "parent";
# Expands to:
has_role(actor: Actor, "admin", resource: Repository) if 
  has_role(actor, "owner", related) and 
  has_relation(resource, "parent", related);
```

Global reference:

```polar
"internal_admin" if global "admin";
# Expands to:
has_role(actor: Actor, "internal_admin", organization: Organization) if has_role(actor, "admin");
```

### Referencing Resources

Use object literal syntax:

```polar
ResourceName{"ident"}
```

## Polymorphism (`extends`)

Polar supports subtype polymorphism through `extends`.

### Actor and Resource Types

Types declared as `resource` extend `Resource`; types declared as `actor` extend `Actor`. This enables shorthand rules to work with all declared types.

```polar
actor User {};
resource Issue {};
```

Creates relationships:

| Supertype  | Subtype |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `Actor`    | `User`  |
| `Resource` | `Issue` |

#### Actor Extends Resource

`Actor` extends `Resource`, so parameters accepting `Resource` also accept `Actor` values.

### Extending User Types

Syntax:

```
(actor | resource) Subtype extends Supertype {}
```

Provides:
- Rule-type polymorphism: rules referencing supertypes accept subtype values
- Inherited permissions, roles, and relations

#### Unification

Subtype values don't unify with their supertype:

```polar
resource Document extends File {}
```

This is always false:

```polar
Document{"a"} = File{"a"}
```

#### Query Type Filtering

Type filters in queries exclude subtypes. Specifying `File` won't return `Document` values.

## Facts as Data

Store facts outside your policy for dynamic authorization data.

### Construction

Facts stored as data must:
- Be unconditionally true (no `if` clause)
- Have all primitive values or object literals

```polar
integer_string_eq(2, "two");
```

### Type Inference

Oso infers fact types from policy usage:

```polar
has_permission(user: User, "pet", dog: Dog) if are_friends(user, dog);
```

Oso accepts only `are_friends(User, Dog)` facts.

### Overriding Inferred Types

Use `declare` for facts not used in policy:

```polar
declare has_tag(User, Tag);
declare has_tag(Dog, Tag);
```

Creates union types - facts matching any declared or inferred type are accepted.

## Built-in Constants

### `@current_unix_time`

Returns current Unix timestamp as `Integer`:

```polar
has_permission(_: Actor, "read", file: File) if
  expires_at(file, time) and @current_unix_time < time;
```
